# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This repository contains the code and resources for my internship project at Bharat Interns, where I worked on predicting house prices using linear regression. The aim of the project was to develop a model that could accurately estimate the prices of houses based on various features.

## Project Overview
- Loading and exploring the dataset
- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, feature scaling, etc.
- Feature analysis and visualization
- Training the linear regression model
- Model evaluation using metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R2 score

## Results
The trained model achieved the following performance metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 91315.49
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 24369146509.23
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 156106.20
- R2 score: 0.83

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the `house_price_prediction.ipynb` notebook to execute the project code.
4. Explore the results and evaluate the model's performance.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
